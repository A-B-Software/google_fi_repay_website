# google_fi_repay_website
This repo will hold a website for the google fi repay project - its a way for young adults to automatically be billed (via splitwise) for their portion of a google fi bill.  Its intended use is for helping people "leave the nest" and gain financial knowledge.


# How it works:

1. An email with the bill is set to the <CLASSIFIED> email address
2. A script downloads the bill, parses it, and sends the amounts to splitwise
3. The young adult on the Google Fi bill is able to pay their portion via Splitwise's integration

# FAQ
* Is this available to the public?
Not at this time and probably not in the near future
* Can this steal money?
Not really - all its doing is forwarding the bill to splitwise.  If it tried to "falsify" the bill, it would be very obvious when you got onto splitwise and looked at it.
* Is this a commercial service?
No - its just helping out some community members at this point.
